# guacamole

My simplified and experimental crate after toying with an idea presented by https://pnevyk.github.io/posts/query-system-in-rust/ blog post. 

Changes:
* Async/Await support
* `Output` associated type which improves a bit ergonomics
* Parameterized queries
* Simplified query implementations


Please keep in mind there is no revision system, nor dependency tracking (yet).
