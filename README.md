# guacamole

My simplified and experimental crate after toying with an idea presented by https://pnevyk.github.io/posts/query-system-in-rust/ blog post. 

Inspired by https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa

## Changes:
* Async/Await support
* `Output` associated type which improves a bit ergonomics
* Parameterized queries
* Simplified query implementations
* Revision system
* Dependency tracking
* Output tracking
* Cycle detection
* Strong consistency

## TODO
* [ ] Cancellation
